## Abstract

This is an implementation of AI-based Face Anti-Spoofing(FAS) Detection. The goal of this project is to perform FAS detection on Rasberry Pi 4. We trained CDCN++ which was proposed in "***Searching Central Difference Convolutional Networks for Face Anti-Spoofing***" from scratch. The model was trained on OULU-NPU and SiW dataset.

## Demo
* #### 明軒桑's facial depth map

* #### Run on Rasberry Pi 4 
(kind of laggy due to the limited computation resources on Rasberry Pi)

## Usage
- Weights
    ```bash
    ```
    Weights can be acquired here.

- Start detecting!
    ```bash
    $ python run.py --detector_path --model_weights
    ```
    Use `--detector_path` and `--model_weights` to assign paths.
